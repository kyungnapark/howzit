                      <p>Francis Cullado was one of the last Getty Marrow interns under Linda’s leadership in 2002 and navigated the VC space in numerous positions before becoming the current Executive Director in 2014. As Executive Director, he oversees VC’s overall activities, comprised of the Armed With a Camera (AWC) Fellowship, Digital Histories, the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival, and the Visual Communications Archives, home to one of the largest repositories of the multifaceted Asian Pacific American experience in the United States. Through his leadership, VC has continued to serve as a space for Asian American, Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander filmmakers and media artists to celebrate heritages, challenge systems, and build community.</p>
            <!---
            In a 2022 Medium article detailing the journey of the AWC Fellowship, he writes:

            "In 2020, Visual Communications reached its 50 year milestone because of community support and collective work. However, this anniversary is also a **product of decades of sacrifices from staff, volunteers, and artists, surviving through periods of scarcity.**"

            As Visual Communications continues to grow and learn in step with the communities it serves, Linda's community-centered values can be clearly seen in the organization's activities, intentions, and the humans that keep it going-whether in periods of scarcity, or periods of abundance.
