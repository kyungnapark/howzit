                    <p>Serving as the longest tenured Executive Director at Visual Communications (VC) from 1984 til her passing in 2003, this exhibition celebrates a community leader widely loved and remembered for her creativity, spontaneity, and infectious laugh. Linda Mabalot, a self-described “country girl” from Dixon, was an activist, journalist, and mentor for newer generations of media artists and leaders. Her impact, or the “Linda Effect”, can be seen most clearly in the people that she collaborated with, mentored, and uplifted. Drawing from Linda’s bursting greeting, “Howzit!: The Linda Mabalot Effect” portrays Linda’s everlasting legacy in the people that she influenced whose work continues to nourish the Asian Pacific American community today.</p>
