Linda Mabalot was a member of the Asian Pacific Student Union (APSU), a statewide coalition of collegians and young adults which emerged following the 1978 Supreme Court case Bakke vs. University of California, which banned race-based quotas in higher education. APSU was a space for students of Asian Pacific American descent to celebrate their heritages and histories, and challenge the ways that higher education served students of color.
