The Asian Pacific Filmmakers Experience was a culmination of the efforts of Linda Mabalot, David Magdael, and Winston Emano to recognize artists of Asian Pacific American descent at the Sundance and Slamdance Film Festivals. In creating space for artists of color, Linda created opportunities for artists to build community, celebrate heritages, and challenge exclusionary systems.
