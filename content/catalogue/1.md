As the longest tenured staff of Visual Communications since 1981, Abraham "Abe" Ferrer has served as a staff documentarian, a mentor to multiple generations of emerging filmmakers, an organizer of community-based film screenings and visual arts events, and as a programmer and co-director of the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival. His encyclopedia-like knowledge and memory has served as an invaluable witness to not only the extensive activities of Visual Communications in its past decades, but to Linda's cultivation of VC as a "home base," to which it has served to many.
