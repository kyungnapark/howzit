As one of the core staff producers for Visual Communicaions, Amy Kato worked closely with Linda to forward various VC productions. A prime example of her impact can be seen in HITO HATA: RAISE THE BANNER, a landmark narrative film dedicated to first generation Japanese Americans, or *issei*, directed by VC founders Eddie Nakamura and Duane Kubo. 
Amy and Linda's work on HITO HATA found new life in the 4K restoration of the film in 2019 thanks to funding from the National Film Preservation Foundation, and has had several 4K restoration premieres in 2022 and 2023 at select notable venues: The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, the 39th Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival, and the Japanese American National Museum.

Decades after the completion of the film, Amy and Linda's impact on the Asian American community lives on through the presentation and amplification of films like HITO HATA that demonstrate the power of media to empower communities-namely, the Little Tokyo community in downtown Los Angeles.
