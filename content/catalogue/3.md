With funding from the city of Los Angeles, Bill Watanabe, the Executive Director of the Little Tokyo Service Center, facilitated the renovation of the former Union Church at 120 Judge John Aiso St. into a multi-use arts complex. Linda, through a partnership with Bill, secured a lasting space for Visual Communications to continue its operations in the historic building that is now known as the Union Center for the Arts. The building now houses three nonprofit arts organizations: East West Players, LA Artcore, and Visual Communications.
