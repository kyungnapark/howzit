Lindaâ€™s leadership and legacy remains steeped in the intersection of media arts and social activism. As a pioneering media arts advocate for Asian American Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander (AANHPI) communities, her programming and institution building continues to bear its own fruit to the present day through the people she mentored and collaborated with. She combatted the idea of AANHPI communities as a monolith by facilitating authentic storytelling across a multitude of filmmakers from different backgrounds and experiences. Linda also recovered Visual Communications from the brink of folding, and in doing so protected one of the largest archives documenting the Asian Pacific American experience in America.
